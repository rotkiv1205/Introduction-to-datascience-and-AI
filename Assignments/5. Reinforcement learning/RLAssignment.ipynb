If you think that the future reward is as important as the current reward you would set this to 0.99999. If you don't care about the future rewards you would set this to 0 and you only care about the current reward. For example, if your discount factor is 0.8 and after 5 steps you get a reward of 4 the present value of that reward is $0.8^4 * 5$ or ~2.\n",
